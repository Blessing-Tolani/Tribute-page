                Ire Aderinokun is a source of inspiration for my career.
                She's my career role model, She makes me see that I can rise higher and achieve my vision.
                I can grow and stand out in my frontend career. A lot of people are into Frontend development but
                just few are at the top leading. I came to stand out not to join the crowd and Ire is a living proof
                and an example of that. <br/>
                Thank you Ire Aderinokun.

                I find programming itself incredibly creative and fulfilling. 
                Every day presents a new challenge and a new thing to learn and I love the endless development I get to make. <br />
                Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do it.
